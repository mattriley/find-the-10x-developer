# August Challenge: Find the 10x Developer

## Background

Jessie, Evan, John, Sarah and Matt are all engineers in the same delivery team (note: any resemblance to actual TWers, living or dead, is purely coincidental)... and each of them has a different level of coding skill to the other. This means it possible to order them from best to... "least best". Importantly, the best of them is the mythical 10x Developer!!!

But which one is it?!?

Here's what we know:

- Jessie is not the best developer
- Evan is not the worst developer
- John is not the best developer or the worst developer
- Sarah is a better developer than Evan
- Matt is not directly below or above John as a developer
- John is not directly below or above Evan as a developer

## Challenge

You need to write a solution to compute these answers:

1. Who is the 10x developer on the team?
2. What is the correct ordering of the members of the team according to their coding skills?
